A wrong reference point(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) is adopted in the calculation of  Table II of "The dilemma between eliminating dominance resistant solutions and preserving boundary solutions of extremely convex Pareto fronts". This mistake does not change the ranking of the algorithm and the conclusion of the paper. Please correct it to (1.1 1.1 1.1) when you verify the result. We are very sorry for the mistake caused.
